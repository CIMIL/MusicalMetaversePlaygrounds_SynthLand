<h2>How to:</h2>

* Clone the repository

* cd in the project folder

* Start the local server:
  
```sh
npm start
```

* We suggest using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/ "ngrok") to forward the experience on the browser of an headset such as Meta Quest.

```sh
ngrok http http://localhost:8080 --region eu
```

than, open your WebXR-compatible browser (i.e. Meta Quest Browser, Wolvic) and type the following address:

```sh
https:/[ngrok-address]/First_Playground.html
```

To fully experience the virtual space, you should use a VR headset such as a Meta Ques 2 or 3.
